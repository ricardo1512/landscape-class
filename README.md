# landscape-class
This Deep Learning project developed a model to classify landscape images using linear classifiers and neural networks. A Python skeleton code was provided by Deep Learning professors at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, and a preprocessed Intel Image Classification dataset was used to compare the performance of a simple linear model and an advanced neural network.
